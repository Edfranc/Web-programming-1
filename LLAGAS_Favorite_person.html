    <p>My favorite person is my sister. Even though I can be troublesome at times and we occasionally argue, she’s always there to help and take care of me in every situation. Now that I’m in college, she’s constantly supporting me in everything I do. She always helps me and never leaves my side. That’s why she is my favorite person.</p>
